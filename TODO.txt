What's next?:
Find out if there's a way to not write out that cumbersome Opcodes::...
Implement all of the binary operations
Implement the memory accesses in the way the original computer did it (or just something easier you're the boss)
Move all of the code to a lib.rs and main.rs, maybe more modules
Debugging information about the computer
Configure my neovim for rust because this is so annoying
Optimize/refactor code after all of this
Create tests for opcodes and errors and whatnot
Make the C compiler and see if it works

Done:
Computer object with working opcodes
